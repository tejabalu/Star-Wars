				Dr. WESLEY BECKNER UNLEASHED<br /><br />Cohort 5
			</p>

			<p class="content-body">
				The dead speak! The galaxy has heard a mysterious broadcast, a
				threat of ANALYTIC REVENGE in the sinister voice of the (data)
				SCIENTIST DR. WESLEY BECKNER.
				<!-- new line -->
				<br /><br />
				GENERAL SINYA dispatches secret agents to gather intelligence
				from cohort 5, while CHANCELLOR MANASA works on her finding
				cosine similarities between nerds and their imperial military
				uniforms.
				<br /><br />
				Meanwhile, EMPEROR CHUAN, the last hope of the Full-stack
				Organization, trains for battle against the diabolical TECH
				INDUSTRY, and SUPREME LEADER TEJA rages in search of the phantom
				python scripts, determined to destroy any threat to the
				DevOps.....
				<br />
				<br />
				The following are some of the objections of Dr. Wesley leaving
				his GIX empire from fellow Cohort 5 Storm Troopers and other
				personnel:

				It is so great to learn in 510! The class is the best
				programming class that I ever had. Thank you. Good luck with
				everything!

				Thank you for being such an awesome teacher! The Python
				foundations class has been super helpful and I learned a lot :)
				Best of luck on your future endeavors!<br />
				- Janice

				While I'm sad to see you go I'm excited for your new
				opportunity! You set a very high bar for instruction quality and
				presentation. Outside of class, I really appreciated our
				conversations and have highly valued your advice and
				perspective. Last, I want to one more time say thank you for
				your support to help shape and improve the MSTI program. Good
				Luck in your future endeavors, I hope our paths cross again!

				<br />
				<br />
				Thanks for all the teachings and conversations! See you in tech!
				<br />- Teja <br /><br />
				Thank you for giving advice and being supportive to all of the

				Dr. Wesley, you were the first one to connect with for most of
				us even before landing in the states, thanks for all the fun
				with code and some random piano musings!

				Hi Wesley, I still remember doing the my technical interview
				with you while I was in Hawaii ðŸ˜‚ The second time I met you was
				when I toured you around in GIX. After opening the doors of the
				Tsinghua room we were both startled when a person walked out. I
				really enjoyed your python courses and they really helped me
				conquer my fear with coding. Thank you for always being so
				encouraging and niceâœ¨ Wish you the best in your job search and
				hope we can bump into each other someday to catch up.
				<br />

				Thank you for the impressive teaching of 510! Wishing you the
				best for your next adventure, may the chicken floss bun be with
				you. Thank you and good luck.

				Sorry for being late :/ Message to Wesley: "Thanks for your
				quality class. Your preparedness, effort and enthusiasm really
				shaped the first quarter of our grad school experience. Good
				luck down south and maybe we'll cross paths again if I ever get
				to escape Puget Sound."
				<br />
				- Sebi

				Thank you for your teaching us in TECHIN 510 class! I am sad
				that you're moving, but I wish you happiness in your new place.
				All the best for the future!

				Hope you have a prosperous conquest ahead! May the whole empire
				bow down to the superior analytical power of Python, empowered
				by Numpy and Pandas, and their vision disillusioned by
				Matplotlib.
