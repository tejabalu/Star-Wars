				Dr. WESLEY BECKNER UNLEASHED<br /><br />Cohort 5
			</p>

			<p class="content-body">
				The dead speak! The galaxy has heard a mysterious broadcast, a
				threat of ANALYTIC REVENGE in the sinister voice of the (data)
				SCIENTIST DR. WESLEY BECKNER.
				<!-- new line -->
				<br /><br />
				GENERAL SINYA dispatches secret agents to gather intelligence
				from cohort 5, while CHANCELLOR MANASA works on her finding
				cosine similarities between nerds and their imperial military
				uniforms.
				<br /><br />
				Meanwhile, EMPEROR CHUAN, the last hope of the Full-stack
				Organization, trains for battle against the diabolical TECH
				INDUSTRY, and SUPREME LEADER TEJA rages in search of the phantom
				python scripts, determined to destroy any threat to the
				DevOps.....
				<br />
				<br />
				The following are some of the objections of Dr. Wesley leaving
				his GIX empire from fellow Cohort 5 Storm Troopers and other
				personnel:

				It is so great to learn in 510! The class is the best
				programming class that I ever had. Thank you. Good luck with
				everything!
				<br />
				- Chen-Yin
				<br />
				<br />

				Thank you for being such an awesome teacher! The Python
				foundations class has been super helpful and I learned a lot :)
				Best of luck on your future endeavors!<br />
				- Janice
				<br />
				<br />
				While I'm sad to see you go I'm excited for your new
				opportunity! You set a very high bar for instruction quality and
				presentation. Outside of class, I really appreciated our
				conversations and have highly valued your advice and
				perspective. Last, I want to one more time say thank you for
				your support to help shape and improve the MSTI program. Good
				Luck in your future endeavors, I hope our paths cross again!
				<br />
				- Garrett

				Thanks for your effort in teaching us and I did learn a lot from
				you. Wish you all the best!!! - GENERAL Hsin-Ya

				Thank you wesley for being such an awesome mentor! I really
				appreciate it, you've taught me a lot and BASS4LYFE
				<br />
				- EMPEROR cHUAN
				<br />
				<br />
				Wesley, It was a pleasure to learn from you. Youâ€™ve been a part
				of many careers at GIX, Hope you find great success in your next
				role!<br />
				- CHANCELLOR Manasa
				<br />
				<br />
				Thanks for all the teachings and conversations! See you in tech!
				<br />- Teja <br /><br />
				Thank you for giving advice and being supportive to all of the
				students in MSTI. Teaching a huge group of students is super
				hard, you are a wonderful teacher. Wish you all the best!<br />
				- Angel
				<br />
				<br />
				Hope you have a prosperous conquest ahead! May the whole empire
				bow down to the superior analytical power of Python, empowered
				by Numpy and Pandas, and their vision disillusioned by
				Matplotlib.
